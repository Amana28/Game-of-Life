In ordedr to run this program from the terminal use the command 
  - java Life (.init file) (Number of Generations to evolve) (Graphic/Text)



The .init is the initial configuration file and indicates the size of the world as well as the location of "live" cells at the very beginning of the program. 
Some .init configurations lend to very beautiful patterns like the moving jelly fish pattern of myconfig.init
